    <p class="govuk-body">We can also email you the initially calculated results that were based on your @(CurrentGender? "sex assigned at birth" : "current gender identity"). Your individual risk results are likely to be between the two because of your gender-affirmation treatment.</p>

    <GDSDetails SummaryText="Why would I want to look at both sets of results?">
        <p class="govuk-body">There is limited research as to whether undergoing gender-affirmation treatments has an impact on your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, or Type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">There is currently not enough research to give a precise risk based on the type and duration of your gender-affirmation treatment. The research available suggests that your risk will change from your sex assigned at birth and move towards your current new gender identity over time. You may wish to view results for both your sex assigned at birth and your current gender identity, because your individual results are likely to be between the two. This approximation will be close, because the difference in the two sets of risk results is about 5%.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You have the option to view both results. You can decide whether you would like to view the second set. In any case, we recognise and respect your current gender identity. We also recognise that this can be a difficult question for some people.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You may want to follow up with a healthcare provider, including someone at your GP clinic, an endocrine or gender identity team (if you are able to access one), or one of the specialist services recommended by trans and non-binary communties such as Dean Street, CliniQ, or the Beaumont Society.</p>
