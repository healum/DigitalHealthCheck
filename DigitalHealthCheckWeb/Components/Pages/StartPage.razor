<p class="govuk-body">This new remote service is an additional option to the current face-to-face service. You can also <a class="govuk-link" title="NHS Find a GP clinic tool" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp">access this service via your local GP Clinic (opens in a new tab)</a>. </p>

<GDSDetails SummaryText="How will the NHS Health Check help me?">
    <p class="govuk-body">Your NHS Health Check can detect potential health problems before they do real damage and help you find ways to lower the risks.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Using the same method as a GP, this tool can estimate how likely it is that you will develop these health problems. It will warn you of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years, and the probability of developing it over the course of your lifetime by estimating your ‘heart age’. It will also identify whether you are at a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It will then show you how small changes can help you reduce these risks, or signpost you to a medical follow-up.</p>
</GDSDetails>

<GDSDetails SummaryText="What follow-ups might I need?">

    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on your situation, the NHS Health Check tool may give you information about the follow-up tests needed to get a clearer picture of your health and where you can access these tests, such as leisure centres and pharmacies. The information provided may include:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>getting your blood pressure tested</li>
        <li>having a test to measure your cholesterol or blood sugar levels</li>
        <li>contacting your GP clinic for a discussion with a healthcare professional</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Your results will automatically be shared with your GP clinic. </p>

<GDSDetails SummaryText="What support is available to help me?">
